**Key Features of the Certificate and Marksheet System**

This certificate and marksheet system, developed in PHP and MySQL, offers several useful features:

1. **Admin Panel** – The admin panel comes with a variety of features that allow the admin to manage and customize certificates and marksheets. The panel is fully secure, ensuring safe access and control.

2. **User Manager** – The admin can create different types of users, either as admins or franchise users. Franchise users can create registrations, certificates, and marksheets, and check transactions, but they cannot edit or delete any data. Admins, however, have full access to all users' data, including the ability to edit or delete records. Admins can also set wallet balances for franchise users, which are used when creating certificates and marksheets. Admins don't need a wallet balance to create certificates or marksheets.

3. **General Settings** – Admins can customize various settings, such as the name of their institute or school, the logo, and the currency for the wallet balance. Additionally, the admin can set the "from" email for two-step verification.

4. **Options** – Admins can adjust settings like the price of certificates and marksheets for franchise users, set grades, and customize subheadings that appear on certificates and marksheets.

5. **More Settings** – This allows for further customization of certificate and marksheet frames, stamps, signatures, and other visual elements.

6. **Course Management** – The system allows admins to create and manage courses, which will then be linked to the certificates and marksheets generated.

7. **Registrations** – Admins can register students with essential details such as name, date of birth, father's name, course, center name, branch code, and a student photo. Admins can also edit or delete these records as needed.

8. **Certificates** – Admins can view and manage all created certificates.

9. **Subject Manager** – Admins can add subjects to courses, which are important for creating marksheets.

10. **Marksheet Manager** – This feature lets admins create marksheets for candidates by selecting the course name, setting the session, marksheet number, date of issue, grades, maximum marks, passing marks, and obtained marks. Once created, marksheets can be viewed and downloaded.

11. **Payment Record** – Admins can track payments made by franchise users for certificates or marksheets.

12. **2-Step Verification** – For added security, the system includes a two-step verification feature, which sends an OTP code to the admin’s or franchise user's email. This ensures that only authorized users can log in.

13. **Franchise Panel** – When a franchise user logs in, the admin panel transforms into a franchise panel, allowing them to manage wallet balances, create registrations, generate certificates and marksheets, and view transaction records.

14. **Wallet** – Franchise users have a wallet balance, which is used when creating certificates and marksheets. Admins can add funds to franchise users' wallets to help them generate these documents.

15. **Certificate Verification** – This feature allows candidates to verify the authenticity of their certificates using a certificate number.

16. **Marksheet Verification** – Similarly, marksheets can be verified using the marksheet number.

17. **QR Code** – A QR code is included on certificates and marksheets, allowing users to scan and verify the documents.

18. **HD Canvas** – The system uses the Canvas library to generate HD-quality certificates and marksheets with a simple button click, requiring no coding knowledge.

19. **Installer** – The system comes with an easy-to-use installer, making it simple to set up on either a localhost or a live server. A demo video guides users through the installation process.

This certificate and marksheet system is designed for ease of use and security, built with PHP using object-oriented programming. It enables users to generate unlimited HD-quality certificates and marksheets efficiently.
